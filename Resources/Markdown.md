# Markdown

##### Embeds support markdown through Discord and this file will show you what you can do, examples, and how to use markdown. Use this when you add fields, type in the description, etc..

#

## Text Formatting

- **Emphasis**, aka italics, with one set of asterisks or underscores around the words you want to italicize.

  For example, \*asterisks\* or \_underscores\_.

  _Italicized messages attract people's attention to the different style_

- **Strong emphasis**, aka bold, with \*\*asterisks\*\*.

  **Bolding messages makes a more dramatic effect to show importance.**

- **Underlining** messages is easy. You just need to use underscores, like this \_\_underscores\_\_,

  So, doing double underscores ends up like t̲h̲i̲s̲.

- **Strikethrough** uses two tildes \~\~like this\~\~.

  This will cause a message to ~~strikeout~~.

- **Other styles are that you can combine these styles to make characters bold and italicized, bold and underlined, etc..**

  For example, **_This message is italicized and bolded._**

#

## Links

- **To add a hyperlink or a "masked link" to the embed, all you need to do is:**

  [text]\(link) which will be [test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

- **For a more advanced link, where people hover over it and shows a title:**

  [text]\(link "hover text") which will be [test](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ 'RickRoll')

## Monospace and Codeblocks

#### You can add monospace, which is just a highlighted text, or codeblocks into embeds.

#### To do either of these, you would need to add backticks or ` to your messages in the correct format.

**Monospace:**

To use monospace, you'll need to add one or two backticks, aka ` or ``, in front of the text and behind it.

`Monospace is super easy to use and it just more or less bolds the background of the text, aka highlighting, it to make it stand out.`

**Codeblocks:**

To use codeblocks, you'll add three backticks, or ```, in front of and behind your text and signify the code you are adding to the block right behind the first three backticks.

```
This is what a codeblock will end up looking like.
```
